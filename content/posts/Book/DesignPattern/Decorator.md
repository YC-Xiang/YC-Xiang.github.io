# Book Notes

**The Decorator Pattern**: attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

- Decorators have the same supertype as the objects they decorate.
- You can use one or more decorators to wrap an object.
- **The decorator adds its own behavior before and/or after delegating to the object it decorates to do the rest of the job.**
