# QEMU

There are two modes in QEMU:

- user mode: execute simple application code in different architecutre. `qemu-xxx`
- system mode: need a kernel img file including the whole os system. `qemu-system-xxx`

## User mode

Compile a 32-bits i386 program：`gcc -m32 hello.c -o hello`

run in qemu by user mode: `qemu-i386 ./hello`

## System mode

In system mode we need to provide kernel, rootfs and other arguments to qemu.

`qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel xxx -initrd xxx -append xxx`

# Compile Kernel

After download linux source code, execute `make` under root directory. When compile finished, `vmlinux` is generated which is the raw kernel including debug info, and `arch/x86/boot/bzImage` which is the compressed kernel。

# Make RootFS

There are two ways, for convenience, only a simple program is written to initrd and is used as the init program. Alternatively, you can use busybox as the init program in initrd.

prepare a simple c program `init.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("hello world\n");
	while(1);
	return 0;
}
```

Then compile the code with `-static` linking.  
`gcc -staic -o init init.c`

Then use the cpio program to package.  
`echo init | cpio -o --format=newc > initrd_rootfs.img`

Thus, an initrd-based rootfs is created.

## Busybox

# Debug the kernel in QEMU

When the kernel and rootfs are ready, we can start the QEMU with

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -kernel ./linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage \
  -initrd initrd_rootfs.img \
  -append "root=/dev/ram rdinit=/init"
```
